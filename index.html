                  <h3>Professional Background</h3>
                    <p>My background is in 3D animation and film production.</p>
                    <p>I have always been interested in learning to program computers for personal and professional reasons. Being an animator and modeler, programming improves the movements and expressions of my characters by improving my rigs. I'm also intrigued by game development and intent to explore game development by developing quality game graphics using my modeling skills. Other than that, I feel learning to communicate with computers is a valuable skill worth the pursuit especially with the advent of web 3.0 with promises interesting tech concepts.</p>
